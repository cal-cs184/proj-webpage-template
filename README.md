# CS184 Project Webpage Repo

The goal of this repo is to provide a template from which students can host CS184 project writeups. 

## Enabling Github Pages

To enable Github pages, go to the 'Settings' tab then click on 'Pages'. Under 'Build and Deployment' -> 'Branch', make sure that the branch is set to 'master' and the folder is set to 'root'. If these settings are correct, you should see a message saying "Your site is live at \[website url\]" at the top of the 'Pages' page, and navigating to the github page link should render index.html

## Adding Project Webpages

There are 5 folders, one for each project. Each contains an index.html file. When the links from the mainpage are clicked, these files will be loaded, so edit these to add your project webpages.
